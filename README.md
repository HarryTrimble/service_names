## Design pattern: check before you start

Help users understand whether they should use your service before they start, so that they don’t waste time and effort

If you do this well, you’ll improve user satisfaction and reduce unnecessary calls and applications to your service team.

## 1. Meet user needs

Before using a transaction users might need to know:

- what they need to do to meet their need, eg apply for a conditional licence so they can learn to drive
- what rules they must follow, eg planning permission
- if they have to use a service, eg drivers medical
- if they can apply, eg carers allowance
- how much it'll cost, eg firearm licence


## 2. Save time and money

You may have problems with your service, eg failure demand, including the following:

You may get calls from users asking:

- how to do a thing, eg apply, register
- what they need to do, eg fill in a form, visit a post office, pay money
- when they need to do specific things, eg phoning before filling in a form
- what rules apply to their situation, eg if they're applying for a visa from outside the EEA and EU
- which forms they might need
- what information do they put in a form

You might be processing applications from users who:

- don't need to apply
- aren't ready to apply
- aren't eligible

## 3. Replace features in your service

You can use this pattern to replace features so you can improve your service.

Features you might want to replace could include:

- phone calls with users helping them prepare applications, also known as "pre app chats"
- lots of instructions on how to fill in a form
- conditions split over multiple documents

## 4. Try an example of this pattern

You can try an example of a [check before you start prototype](https://check-before-you-start.herokuapp.com/)

To prevent the public stumbling across the prototype and thinking it's gov.uk, we given the link a username and password:

Username: govdesign
password: design_patterns
